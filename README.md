This is a Front End Development project in which I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a music player. The centre player interface features a cover picture of the song, the song title, and a progress bar that displays the track's current and total duration. Track playback, pause, and skipping controls are located underneath the progress bar. The player seamlessly mixes visual and functional components to deliver an enjoyable music listening experience.
